### Project Description

During my time at Hermelin College, I implemented a recursive algorithm in C to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of recursion. Minesweepers is the result of this effort, showcasing the application of theoretical concepts in a real-world programming scenario.

### Key Features

- **Recursive Algorithm**: Minesweepers incorporates a powerful recursive algorithm, demonstrating a sophisticated approach to problem-solving.

### How to Run

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Build and compile the code.
3. Run the executable file.

### Skills Acquired

This project has equipped me with valuable skills, including:
- Advanced problem-solving techniques.
- In-depth understanding and implementation of recursion.
- Experience in working with Visual Studio and C.

### Future Challenges

Minesweepers has laid a solid foundation for tackling future programming challenges. The skills acquired during its development will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping my programming journey.
